# Simple_log_watcher
hey! this is my first cyber security tool, which is a log watcher.  it's small but it's just a start of my career :).

16/12/2025 - reads -> parses -> filters by: level, keywd, level & keywd
17/12/2025 - reads -> parses -> filters by: level, keywd, date range -> gives stats or only counts
